# Review_Sentimental_Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews using deep learning and natural language processing. It leverages a custom Word2Vec embedding to convert text into meaningful numerical representations and a Keras-based neural network for classification. The model achieves 89% accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. An interactive Streamlit application is provided for real-time sentiment prediction, allowing users to input their own movie reviews and instantly see the sentiment result.
